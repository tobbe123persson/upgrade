! LaTeX cmd Error: Verbatim-like command '\foo' illegal in argument.
For immediate help type H <return>.
 ...                                              
l. ...\foo#
The command '\foo' takes a verbatim argument and should therefore normally not
be used in arguments of other commands or environments. LaTeX found an illegal
token (##) after '' and will drop everything up to this point.
Expect further (low-level) errors.
